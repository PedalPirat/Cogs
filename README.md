# Cogs⚙️
Cogs are the physical modules that build up the PedalPirat Ecosystem. They are connected via the [Chain](https://github.com/PedalPirat/Chain), a mix of Bus and power that makes sure that all components can connect with each other.

## Functions
Every cog has one or multiple functions.

They can be a custom or premanufactured part.

The functions are:
### 🏮[Lantern](https://github.com/PedalPirat/Lantern) - Light controller and modules
### 🔧[Rudder](https://github.com/PedalPirat/Rudder) - Actors to controll Shifters and other stuff
### 🔭[Telescope](https://github.com/PedalPirat/Telescope) - Sensors to gather data
### 🔋[PowderKeg](https://github.com/PedalPirat/PowderKeg) - Power Management 
### 🛞[Tiller]
