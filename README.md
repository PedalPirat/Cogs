# Cogs⚙️
Cogs are the physical modules that build up the PedalPirat Ecosystem. They are connected via the 🔗[Chain](https://github.com/PedalPirat/Chain), a mix of Bus and power that makes sure that all components can connect with each other.

## Overview
Every cog has one or multiple functions.
They can be either existing products or custom modules.
